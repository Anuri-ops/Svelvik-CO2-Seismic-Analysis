# Svelvik CO₂ Seismic Monitoring

This project applies **time-lapse seismic analysis** techniques to monitor subsurface changes during **CO₂ injection** at the Svelvik CO₂ Field Lab.  
Using Python-based workflows, we inspect, clean, and compare seismic signals to detect plume-related behavior in a shallow reservoir.

It supports the open science goals of **IEAGHG CO₂ DataShare**, providing a reproducible, transparent baseline for future MMV (Monitoring, Measurement & Verification) tool development.

## 🎯 Objective

To identify and interpret time-lapse changes in seismic responses caused by CO₂ plume migration, focusing on:

- Waveform shape and amplitude differences
- Signal envelope energy (attenuation/scattering)
- First arrival time shifts (velocity anomalies)

---

## 🧠 Methodology

We follow a structured workflow:

```
SEG-2 Files → Inspect → Clean → Compare (Baseline vs Injection) → Interpret (Plume Effects)
```

The analysis compares signals from three monitoring stages:

- **Baseline data** (pre-injection)
- **Injection-phase data**
- **Post-injection data**

---

## 🔍 Key Findings

### 🔸 Amplitude Envelope Comparison

Post-injection waveforms show **reduced signal energy**, consistent with scattering and absorption by the migrating CO₂ plume.

### 🔸 Multi-Trace Overlay

Overlaying seismic traces reveals:

- **Arrival-time shifts**
- **Amplitude flattening**
- **Phase and frequency changes**

These observations are consistent with plume presence and changes in pore saturation within the injected zone.
