# Svelvik COâ‚‚ Seismic Monitoring

This project analyzes SEG-2 seismic files from the Svelvik COâ‚‚ Field Lab to monitor subsurface changes caused by COâ‚‚ plume migration.

Using Python-based workflows, we inspect, clean, and compare seismic signals from:
- **Baseline data** (pre-injection)
- **Injection data**
- **Post-injection data**

Our goal is to detect and interpret COâ‚‚-related changes using waveform characteristics and signal energy comparison.

##  Objective

To detect and interpret plume-related changes in:
- Waveform shape and amplitude
- Signal energy (envelope)
- First arrival time (velocity shift)

---

##  Methodology

We follow a structured pipeline:

```
Files â†’ Inspect â†’ Clean â†’ Compare (Baseline vs Injection) â†’ Interpret (Plume)
```

---

##  Key Findings

### Amplitude Envelope Comparison

Post-injection waveforms show reduced envelope energy, suggesting scattering and attenuation due to plume interaction.

### Multi-Trace Overlay

Overlaying traces reveals:
- Arrival time shifts
- Amplitude flattening
- Phase changes

These patterns suggest saturation or gas presence in the plume-affected region.
